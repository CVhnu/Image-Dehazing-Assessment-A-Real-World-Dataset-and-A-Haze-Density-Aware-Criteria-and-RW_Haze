# Image Dehazing Assessment: A Real-World Dataset and A Haze Density-Aware Criteria & RW_Haze
<img src=https://github.com/jiyouchen103/RW_Haze/blob/main/paper/2.png >

Example images from the proposed RW-Haze dataset. (a) is the reference image. (b)-(e) are well-aligned real-world hazy images with increasing haze levels, and their labels are presented below. Each scene is captured by a fixed camera, ensuring the spatial alignment of images. Furthermore, the hazy images and corresponding references are captured at short intervals, some within an hour. The pristine recording time is displayed in the upper left corner and zoomed in on the top.

*Qualitatively and quantitatively comparison of the dehazed results generated by 10 different dehazing methods.


## The proposed framework DehIQA

## The pre-training weight Download
* The [weight](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1p1dX4S3gpuWZcWgvLPOqtA)[password=fti2]

## Emphasis
* The RW-HAZE dataset only releases one clear image and five corresponding hazy images with different haze densities for six scenes. The other images have not been made public due to confidentiality needs.
