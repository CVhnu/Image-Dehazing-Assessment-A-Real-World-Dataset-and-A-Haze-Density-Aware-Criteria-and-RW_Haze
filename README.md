Example images from the proposed RW-Haze dataset. (a) is the reference images. (b)-(e) are well-aligned real-world hazy images with increasing haze levels, and their labels are presented below. Each scene is captured by a fixed camera, ensuring the spatial alignment of images. Furthermore, the hazy images and corresponding references are captured at short intervals, some within an hour. The pristine recording time is displayed in the upper left corner and zoomed in on the top.
